# Heaps and Heapsort

## Drozdek Ch. 6.9

---


## Heaps

A .term[heap] is a kind of (usually binary) tree.  They normally come in two varieties:

* .term[Min-Heaps] always maintain the smallest value at the root.
* .term[Max-Heaps] always maintain the largest value at the root.

--
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
_There is also a more exotic heap called a &#34;.term[min-max-heap]&#34; that allows you
to find the smallest and largest values in constant time, but we won&#39;t consider
that variation here._


---


## Heaps

In order to be a Heap, the following properties must hold (a _min heap_ is used as an example; for a _max heap_ just reverse the comparison operator).

* The empty tree is a heap.
* A non-empty tree is a heap if and only if the .term[heap property] is satisfied for all nodes in the tree.


---


## The _Heap Property_

The .term[heap property], for any node in a tree, states:

* A node with no children satisfies the heap property.
* A node with one or more children satisfies the heap property if and only if: 
    *  (for a _min-heap_) The subtree rooted at node $R$ is a min-heap if each of $R$&#39;s child subtrees are min-heaps and the values of each of $R$&#39;s direct descendants (if they exist) are greater than or equal to the value at $R$. 
    
    *  (for a _max-heap_) The subtree rooted at node $R$ is a max-heap if each of $R$&#39;s child subtrees are max-heaps and the values of each of $R$&#39;s direct descendants (if they exist) are less than or equal to the value at $R$.

## Binary Min Heap

## Heap Convention

It is convention (not strictly a requirement) that heaps &#34;fill in&#34; at the leaf level from left-to-right, as shown in the image below.

&#43; All leaves are on the tree at level $h$ or $h-1$ where $h$ is the tree height.
&#43; The tree is balanced.
&#43; Leaves are added at level $h$ from left-to-right.

&lt;td&gt;.right[![:scale Max Heap in Array, 80%](../images/HeapSort/heap_in_array_both_views.svg)]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

---


## Heap Convention

This allows us to make an easy representation of a heap in an array, by applying the following rules:

- The first item in the array (index $0$) is the root.
- An item at any index $i$ can find its left-child at index $2i&#43;1$ and its right-child at index $2i&#43;2$.
    - By inverse relation, the parent of any node is at index $(i-1)/2$ using integer division.

---


## Inserting Into a Heap

When inserting a new item in an existing heap, the item must be placed into a leaf, then the heap property must be restored.

- Insert at leaf
    &#43; first &#34;empty&#34; location in the array
- Restore Heap
    &#43; &#34;Percolate up&#34;

---


## Removing From a Heap

We generally only care about removing the item at the root of the heap.

- Since the heap is an array, this would open a &#34;hole&#34; at the beginning.
    &#43; &#34;shifting&#34; the entire array left would be expensive.
- Instead, the value of the last leaf is moved up to the root position, and then the heap property must be restored.
    - This re-heapify is a simple operation.
    - Usually referred to as &#34;_sift-down_&#34;.

## Heapify

If an array can be represented as a tree, then it should be possible to convert any arbitrary array to a min or max heap.  We call this operation _heapify_.

- How can we perform _heapify_?
    &#43; Top-down
    &#43; Bottom-up

    &#43; Top-down
        * Construct the heap by using the algorithm for insertion into an empty heap. (Can be performed in-place.)

        * Construct the heap by first making heaps from all of the subtrees (beginning at the leaves) and working toward the root.

## Uses for Heaps

- Priorty Queue
    &#43; More space-efficient VS a linked-list Pri. Queue.
- As the underlying data structure for _Heapsort_.

---


## Heapsort

- First the array must be made into a heap by running _heapify_.
    &#43; Traditionally a max heap is used.
- Then, the sort proceeds by taking advantage of the partial ordering provided by the heap property.  On each &#34;pass&#34;
    &#43; The maximum item is always at the top, so on each iteration, &#34;remove&#34; it by swapping it with the last element of the remaining heap.
        * reduce the &#34;size&#34; of the heap by 1
    &#43; Restore the heap property by performing a sift-down from the root.


---

## Heapsort Complexity

- _Heapify_ (bottom-up) takes $O(n)$ steps.
    &#43; (top-down) takes $O(n\lg(n))$ steps.
- Each &#34;pass&#34; yields 1 value in the right place.
- $n$ passes are required to sort all items.
- _Sift-Down_ takes $O(\lg(n))$ steps.

        * (done once) 
- Each &#34;pass&#34; yields 1 value in the right place.
- $n$ passes are required to sort all items.
- _Sift-Down_ takes $O(\lg(n))$ steps. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Overall:  $O(n\lg(n))$
