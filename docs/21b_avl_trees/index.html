# AVL-Trees
## Drozdek Ch. 6.7

## Keep your Balance

An _AVL Tree_ is a tree where the height of the left and right subtrees always differ by at most one.

* Each node has an associated _balance factor_
    * `balance = height(right) - height(left)`

* The AVL property states that the balance factor at all nodes must be in the range $[-1,1]$.

---

## Balance

If the magnitude of any node&#39;s balance factor becomes $&gt;1$, the tree must be balanced.

* 4 cases (but 2 are symmetrical):
    * &#34;Heavy&#34; on left subtree of left child.
    * &#34;Heavy&#34; on right subtree of left child.
    * &#34;Heavy&#34; on right subtree of right child.
    * &#34;Heavy&#34; on left subtree of right child.

---

## Fixing the Balance

When the balance factor rule is broken, we must correct the balance.  That can be done
by applying a transformation to the tree&#39;s shape called a .term[rotation].  The rotation
can be performed either in a clockwise (_right_) direction, or counter-clockwise 
(_left_) direction.

A single rotation will have the effect of shifting some of the &#34;weight&#34; from one side 
of the node about which we are rotating (we call this node the .term[pivot] node) to
the other.

---

### Rotations

.term[**Rotate Left**]

.center[![:scale Rotate Left - $Q$ is the pivot node., 70%](../images/avl_tree/tree_rotate_left.svg &#34;Rotate Left - $Q$ is the pivot node.&#34;)]

.tight[
(a) The tree is balanced w.r.t. node _P_

(b) A value is added to the subtree on the right of _Q_, increasing its height by one. This causes the balance factor at _P_ to become &#43;2, which is no longer considered balanced.

(c) A single .term[left rotation] is performed at node _P_.  This results in _Q_ becoming the parent of _P_, and the tree is again balanced.  (Note that _Q_&#39;s left subtree became _P_&#39;s right subtree in the rotation.)
]

### Rotations

**Rotate Left**

.center[![:scale Rotate Left - $Q$ is the pivot node., 60%](../images/avl_tree/tree_rotate_left.svg &#34;Rotate Left - $Q$ is the pivot node.&#34;)]

.term[**Rotate Right**]

* _Mirror image of above._

The single rotations only solve the problem when the tree is &#34;heavy&#34; along the &#34;outside&#34; of the subtree (heavy on left side of left child, or on right side of right child).

---

## Double-Rotations

If the tree is &#34;heavy&#34; in the &#34;inside&#34; of a subtree (either the right-side of a left child, or the left-side of a right child) then a double rotation is required:

* left-right
    * Just a left-rotate at the child, followed by a right-rotate at the original (pivot) node with the &amp;plusmn;2 balance factor.

* right-left
    * Just a right-rotate at the child, followed by a left-rotate at the original (pivot) node with the &amp;plusmn;2 balance factor.
