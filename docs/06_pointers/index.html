# Pointers
## Gaddis Ch. 9

---

## Addresses and Data

Every variable in a program is stored at a unique memory address.

The unary **`&amp;`** is the **_address operator_**; the address operator retrieves the address of its operand:

``` cpp
int x = 42;
// Print out the address at which x is stored:
std::cout &lt;&lt; &amp;x &lt;&lt; &#34;\n&#34;;
```

---

## Pointers

* A _pointer_ is a variable that stores a memory address.
    - Declare by adding the _pointer type modifier_ ( **`  *  `** ) to a variable declaration.
        &#43; The pointer will hold the address of a value of the specified type.

**Example: (pointer to an `int`)**

``` cpp
int x = 75;    // just a normal integer
// [...]
int* xPtr;     // declare a pointer to an int
xPtr = &amp;x;     // point xPtr to x
```

---

## Why?

* Low-level access.
    - To provide explicit, direct access (no copy) in a similar way to what we do implicity with _pass by reference_.
* Iteration
    - Pointer math makes array manipulation through pointers very convenient.
    - Advanced data structures may only allow iteration through pointers.
* Dynamic Memory Allocation
    - Memory generated at runtime is only identified to the program through its address.

---

## Why? (simplified)

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

**Observation and Modification**     

* **_Observing_ Pointers:** Pointers can be used to _observe_ the contents of memory, and potentially to _modify_ the values under observation as well.    
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

**Ownership**     

* **_Owning_ Pointers:** Pointers can be used to maintain &#34;ownership&#34; of dynamically-allocated memory resources.

---

## Physical View

``` cpp
int x = 75;    // just a normal integer
// [...]
int* xPtr;     // declare a pointer to an int
xPtr = &amp;x;     // point xPtr to x
```

The following figure illustrates the _physical view_ of what a pointer actually looks like in memory.  The pointer `xPtr` contains the _address_ of the location where `x` is stored:

---

## Logical View

``` cpp
int x = 75;    // just a normal integer
// [...]
int* xPtr;     // declare a pointer to an int
xPtr = &amp;x;     // point xPtr to x
```

The following figure illustrates the _logical view_ of what a pointer conceptually does.  The pointer `xPtr` _points to_ the the variable `x`:

## Physical and Logical View

``` cpp
int x = 75;    // just a normal integer
// [...]
int* xPtr;     // declare a pointer to an int
xPtr = &amp;x;     // point xPtr to x
```

## Indirection

Knowing the address of where something is stored gives a programmer low-level access to the data at that location.

* Pointers store the addresses of other variables; they give us _indirect control_ over the values in those variables.
* The **_indirection operator_** (**` * `**) allows us to &#34;follow&#34; a pointer to the address it is storing, so that we may operate on the data stored there.
    - This is known as _dereferencing_ the pointer.
    - The indirection operator is also sometimes called the _dereference operator_.

**Example: Using a Pointer**

``` cpp
int x = 75;                  // just a normal integer

// [...]          

int* xPtr;                   // declare a pointer to an int
xPtr = &amp;x;                   // point xPtr to x

// [...]          

*xPtr = 100;                 // use xPtr, change value in x
std::cout &lt;&lt; *xPtr &lt;&lt; &#34;\n&#34;;  // prints 100
std::cout &lt;&lt; x     &lt;&lt; &#34;\n&#34;;  // x is also 100 now.
```

---

## &#34;Null&#34; Pointers

A pointer that doesn&#39;t point to _any_ (legal) memory address is referred to as a &#34;null pointer&#34;.

* C&#43;&#43;11 added a keyword to represent the literal value of a null pointer:  `nullptr`.

```cpp
int* x = nullptr; // declare and initialize to nullptr
```
* Setting a pointer to `nullptr` guarantees that it cannot be _dereferenced_.
    &#43; (Basically, you can&#39;t use a null pointer for anything.) 

---

### Pointers are Similar to...

* Pass-by-Reference
    - actually passes an _address_, not a data value
    - does so implicitly; programmer does not need to take any action
* Arrays
    - array variables are _reference types_
    - array variable will degrade to a pointer to the array when used in an expression without index notation (**`[i]`**).

---

## Pointers to Arrays

``` cpp
int a[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };  // normal array
```

**Pointers can be used to access elements of an array.**

``` cpp 
int* aPtr = a; // no need for `&amp;`: `a` degrades to a pointer
```

**Pointer mathematics.**      
&lt;small style=&#34;font-size: 70%;&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is why the **type** is important for pointers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

``` cpp
std::cout &lt;&lt; *(aPtr &#43; 2) &lt;&lt; &#34;\n&#34;; // prints a[2]
```

**Pointer and array notation is interchangeable.**

``` cpp
std::cout &lt;&lt; aPtr[2] &lt;&lt; &#34;\n&#34;;  // easier than &#34;*(aPtr &#43; 2)&#34;
```

---

## More Pointer Math

Pointers support the following mathematical operations:

```
Operation           Example      Description
----------------------------------------------------
 &lt;ptr&gt; &#43; &lt;int&gt;      xPtr &#43; 3     Add an offset
 &lt;ptr&gt; - &lt;int&gt;      xPtr - 2     Subtract an offset
 &#43;&#43;&lt;ptr&gt;            &#43;&#43;xPtr       (pre) increment
 &lt;ptr&gt;&#43;&#43;            xPtr&#43;&#43;       (post) increment
 --&lt;ptr&gt;            --xPtr       (pre) decrement
 &lt;ptr&gt;--            xPtr--       (post) decrement
 &lt;ptr&gt; - &lt;ptr&gt;      xPtr - yPtr  Offset distance 
                                 between two pointers
```

---

## Pointers as &#34;Iterators&#34;

You can use a pointer to &#34;move around&#34; in an array:

``` cpp
int a[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
// [...]
int* begin = a;               // start is first addr of a
int* end   = a &#43; 5;           // end is start &#43; size

// &#34;For each element in a&#34;, using a pointer for movement:
for(int* current = begin; current != end; current&#43;&#43;){
    std::cout &lt;&lt; *current &lt;&lt; &#34;\t&#34;;
}
```

This design pattern is very common in the C&#43;&#43; Standard Template Library.

### `const` Pointers and Pointers to Constants

* A pointer can be declared constant
    - `int* const ptr;`
        &#43; Here, the pointer&#39;s _value_ (target address) cannot be changed.
* A pointer can be use to _point to a constant_:
    - `const int* ptr;`
        &#43; Here, the pointer cannot be used to modify the target _data_.
* Finally, you can have a constant pointer to a constant:
    - `const int* const ptr;`
        &#43; Neither the pointer nor its target may be changed.

---

## Passing Pointers to Functions

* A pointer may be used as an alternative syntax for passing a 1-D array to a function.
    - Pointer notation is commonly used for c-strings, for example.
* Pointer values behave as a _primitive type_.
    - They are passed _by value_, like all other primitive types.
* Pointers may also be passed by reference if the address in the pointer itself should be changed by the function.
    - Doing so requires adding the _reference type modifier_  (` &amp; `)to the formal parameter, just like with any other primitive data.
