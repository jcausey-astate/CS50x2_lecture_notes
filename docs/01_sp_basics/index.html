# Structured&lt;br /&gt;Programming&lt;br /&gt;Basics

## Gaddis (Ch. 1, 2)


---

## First Principles

* _computer_ - a programmable machine designed to follow instructions
    - Computers are able to perform mathematical and logical operations at great speed.
* _algorithm_ - a precise, step-by-step plan for solving a problem
* _program_ - a set of instructions expressed in a _programming language_ that a computer follows to perform a task
* _programmer_ - a person who writes a computer program
* _programming language_ - any language designed specifically for use in creating computer programs

---

### A computer is simply a re-configurable mechanical tool. 

Programmers use programs to direct the behavior of the machine.  

So, a computer is the ultimate &#34;Swiss Army Knife&#34;.

---

## Computer Code

Computers execute code that is stored in _computer memory_ in a _binary_ form.

    11000111 01000100 00100100 00000100 00011000 10000111 00000100

Humans are not skilled at writing in machine language.

## Language Levels

* Low-Level 
    - Machine Language
        &#43; Pure binary, but usually expressed as hexadecimal
    - Assembly Language
        &#43; Corresponds more or less 1:1 with machine language (easy conversion)
        &#43; More human-readable (for some definition of _more_)
* High-Level
    - C, C&#43;&#43;, Python, Swift, etc.
        &#43; Designed to look like a human language
        &#43; Must be translated to machine language

## A Complete C&#43;&#43; Program:

``` cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(){
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Hello, World!\n&#34;;
    return 0;
}

```

Now, we will take a look at the parts of the program, and see what each part does.

---

## Program Parts

``` cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
```

* This line is called a _preprocessor directive_.  
* It communicates with a phase of the C&#43;&#43; compiler called the _preprocessor_, telling it to include code from a file named _&#34;iostream&#34;_, which is a C&#43;&#43; library.  
* The _iostream_ library contains code that is used for input and output activities.


---

## Program Parts

``` cpp
int main()
```

* This line is called a _function header_.
* It begins the definition of a function called &#34;main&#34;.
* Every C&#43;&#43; program *must* contain a `main()` function.
    - The `main()` function tells the computer where to begin executing.
    - Instructions will be executed one at a time, starting with the first line of `main`.


---

## Program Parts

```cpp
{

}
```

* The _curly braces_ enclose a _block_ of code in C&#43;&#43;.
* __block__ - a set of related C&#43;&#43; statements that perform an action
* Every opening curly brace must match with a closing brace.  
    - We indent the code between the `{` and the `}`.


---
## Program Parts

``` cpp
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Hello, World\n&#34;;
```
.small-95[
* This _statement_ sends the words &#34;Hello, World&#34; to the screen.
* `std::cout` is the name of the _standard output_ _stream_
    - A _stream_ is a one-way flow of data from the point of view of the program.
* `&lt;&lt;` is the _stream insertion operator_, used to place things into a stream.
* `&#34;Hello, World!\n&#34;` is a _string literal_; a _string_ is just a collection of characters that are treated as a single unit.
    - String literals are always surrounded by double-quotes.
]

* **_literal_**: A literal is a value that is typed directly into the source code, in a representation that the programming language recognizes as a value of a recognized type.  Literal values must be formatted according to the syntax rules of the language.

---

## Escape Characters

``` cpp
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Hello, World\n&#34;;
```

&lt;small&gt;We often want to include _control characters_ in our string literals, but we don&#39;t have the ability to type these in directly.  C&#43;&#43; allows the use of _escape characters_ for this purpose.&lt;/small&gt;

* __escape character__ - any character combination beginning with &#34;`\`&#34;, used to represent a character that cannot otherwise be represented in a string literal.

.small-80[

__Examples:__

    Code     Meaning
    -----------------
     \n      newline (think of the &lt;ENTER&gt; key)
     \t      tab character
     \&#34;      allows a double-quote in a string literal
     \\      allows a backslash in a string literal
     \r      carriage-return (used in Windows line endings: &#34;\r\n&#34;)

]

---
## Program Parts

``` cpp
    return 0;
```

* This line terminates the program by causing the `main()` function to return the value `0` to the operating system.
    - No code following this line would ever be executed; this means that the `return 0;` line will always be the last line in `main()`.
* The operating system considers zero to be an indication that the program ran normally.  
    -  Other values are possible, and we will use them later.

---

__Terms from Program Parts__

* _preprocessor_ : compiler component that works on the source code itself.  Directives start with `#` symbol.
* _library_ or _header_ : a file containing C&#43;&#43; code that adds functionality to your program.
* _statement_ : a single logical step expressed in C&#43;&#43; (usually one line)  _Ends with a semicolon!_
* _stream_ : a one-way flow of data in a program
* _literal_ : a data value that is hard-coded in a program
* _string_ : a collection of characters treated as a single data value
* _block_ : a collection of related statements surrounded by curly braces

* User&#39;s Side: Editing, running and testing.
* Server Side: Stores files, provides compiler and other tools.

## Practice Developing and Compiling

``` cpp
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(){
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Hello, World!\n&#34;;
    return 0;
}

```

Make modifications to the program so that it will print out your name, favorite food, and favorite TV series.
