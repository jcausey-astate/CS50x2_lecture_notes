# Exceptions

## (When Everything Goes Wrong)

## Gaddis Ch. 16

---

## Exceptions

* Used to communicate that something unexpected has occurred.
* Allows the programmer to deal with unexpected situations in a controlled manner.
* May be as simple or as complex as desired (depending on usage in the program)
* In C&#43;&#43;, _any_ data value can be used as an exception!

---

## Key Words

__*`throw`*__ - Used to generate an exception and “throw” it up the _call stack_.

__*`try`*__ – Used to enclose a block of code in which an exception _might_ occur (allowing the programmer to handle it if it does).

__*`catch`*__ – Used to detect and handle a specific type of exception, if it _actually occurred_ during execution of a `try` block.

---

## Exceptions are about _Communication_

When something goes very wrong _in a way that you cannot fix in the local context_, exceptions give you a way to communicate that problem to a higher level in the program structure.

---

### Exceptions are:
* **out-of-band**
    - They don&#39;t add complexity to function or object **interfaces**.
        &#43; They let the parameters and return types represent whatever they _naturally_ should, without mixing in error signaling.

* **impossible to ignore**
    - Someone using your library can&#39;t just ignore them (and expect their program to keep running).
    - It forces us to think about what kinds of errors may happen.

Exceptions are a way to handle things that *shouldn&#39;t have happened* when they inevitably *do happen*.

---

## Flow of Control

When something unexpected happens, a function may choose to throw an exception.  
* At this point, execution leaves the function immediately!
* Exception moved up the call stack until a `try` with a matching  `catch` clause is found.
    - Execution resumes with the first line of the `catch` block (if found).
* If not caught, the exception eventually makes it up to the OS, which will shut down the process.

__Example__

```{cpp}
// function that *may* throw an exception
int totalDays(int days, int weeks){
    if((days &lt; 0) || (days &gt; 7)){
        // value being thrown is a C-string:
        throw &#34;Invalid value for days.&#34;;
    }
    if(weeks &lt; 0){
        throw &#34;Invalid value for weeks.&#34;;
    }
    return 7 * weeks &#43; days;
}
```

---

&lt;!-- .slide: data-transition=&#34;none&#34;, data-background=&#34;aliceblue&#34; --&gt;

__Example: Handling the Exception__

```{cpp}
int main(){
    int days, weeks;
    cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Enter days and weeks separated by space: \n&#34;;
    cin  &gt;&gt; days &gt;&gt; weeks;
    
    try {  
        int totDays = totalDays(days, weeks);
        cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Total days: &#34; &lt;&lt; totDays;
    }
    catch (const char* msg) {
        cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Error: &#34; &lt;&lt; msg;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

*Should* you *rely* on exception handling here?  (**NO**, you should check the values first.)

But, exceptions provide an impossible-to-ignore failsafe in case the person writing `main()` wasn&#39;t thinking about checking pre-conditions.

---

## What Happens?
* `try` block is entered.  `totalDays()` function is called.
* If 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; parameter is between 0 and 7, calculate the number of days and return as usual (no exception).
* If 1st parameter is out of range, exception of type `const char*` is thrown: Execution leaves the function immediately.
* `try` block execution is halted, execution jumps to first `catch` block, looking for a &lt;br /&gt;
`catch(const char*)` &lt;br /&gt;
* Since the type matches, execution resumes in the `catch` block.

---

&lt;!-- .slide: data-transition=&#34;none&#34;, data-background=&#34;aliceblue&#34; --&gt;

__Example: Exceptions Can&#39;t be Ignored__

```{cpp}
int main(){
    int days, weeks;
    cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Enter days and weeks separated by space: \n&#34;;
    cin  &gt;&gt; days &gt;&gt; weeks;
    // No validity check at all!
    int totDays = totalDays(days, weeks);
    cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Total days: &#34; &lt;&lt; totDays;

    return 0;
}
```

This code does not check to see if the values entered are valid.  

If they aren&#39;t the exception will be thrown, but not caught, and the program will crash.

**Exceptions cannot be (implicitly) ignored!**

---

&lt;!-- .slide: data-transition=&#34;none&#34;, data-background=&#34;aliceblue&#34; --&gt;

__Example: Checking Pre-Conditions__

```{cpp}
int main(){
    int days, weeks;
    cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Enter days and weeks separated by space: \n&#34;;
    cin  &gt;&gt; days &gt;&gt; weeks;
    // check pre-conditions first:
    if( days &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; days &lt; 7 &amp;&amp; weeks &gt;= 0 ){
        int totDays = totalDays(days, weeks);
        cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Total days: &#34; &lt;&lt; totDays &lt;&lt; &#39;\n&#39;;
    }
    else{
        cout &lt;&lt; &#34;You entered invalid values.\n&#34;;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code checks the pre-conditions before calling `totDays()`, so the exception can&#39;t be thrown.

This is probably the &#34;best&#34; (most well thought-out) implementation.

---

## Notes
* Many `catch` blocks may follow a single `try` (but there must be at least one).
* You cannot `catch` without `try`, or `try` without `catch`.
* `catch` blocks are scanned until one matches the type of the exception thrown.
* `catch` blocks may or may not have formal parameter name (depending on whether the exception value itself will be needed inside the block).

---

## Missed Exceptions
* Failure to catch an exception just means it continues “flying” up the call stack. 
* If it gets all the way out of `main()` without being caught, the program will be terminated by the OS.
* It is possible to define a “catch-all” `catch` block (although it is often considered sloppy to do so):&lt;br /&gt;
`catch( ... )` &lt;br /&gt;  
    * If you define a “catch-all”, it should be the last `catch` in the chain.

---

## Exception Classes/Objects
* Any type may be thrown.  Even custom objects.
* We can define objects specifically for this purpose.
* _Exception classes_ are useful to put a meaningful name on the type (so that `catch` blocks are easy to understand).

**Example**

`catch( NullPointerException )` &lt;br /&gt;  
is better than &lt;br /&gt;   
`catch( int )`

---

## Exception Classes

* Don’t necessarily need members
    - Unless they do: if the added functionality is useful, add it!

**Example**

```{cpp}
class NullPointerException{ };  // empty
```

Or:

```{cpp}
class NullPointerException{
    public:
        string msg;            // with attribute
};
```

---

## Standard Exceptions
The C&#43;&#43; Standard Library defines an `exception` base class in the `&lt;exception&gt;` header.

* Useful (later) to make our own exceptions with nice common behaviors.

```{cpp}
#include&lt;exception&gt;
    using std::exception;

class NullPointerException : public exception{
    public:
        virtual const char* what()const {
            return “A null pointer was encountered.”;
        }
};
```

---

## Standard Exceptions

Also, _Polymorphism_!

```{cpp}
try{
    [...] 
}
catch(exception&amp; e){   
    // catches _any_ standard exception!
    cout &lt;&lt; e.what()  &lt;&lt; endl;
}
```

---

**Pre-Defined Standard Exceptions**

The `&lt;stdexcept&gt;` header defines some standard exception classes that are ready-to-use.  They are divided into two sets (names are self-explanatory):

**Logic errors**
```cpp
logic_error      
domain_error     
invalid_argument 
length_error
out_of_range
```

**Runtime errors**

```cpp
runtime_error   
range_error     
overflow_error  
underflow_error 
```

---

**Other Useful Standard Library Exceptions**

```cpp
    exception
    bad_alloc
    bad_cast
    bad_exception
    bad_typeid
    ios_base::failure
```

---

## Documentation Guidelines

Exceptions require some new documentation...  Here&#39;s an example:

```cpp
/**
 * converts a numerical ranking in {1,2,3} to the corresponding 
 * medal color from {&#34;gold&#34;,&#34;silver&#34;,&#34;bronze&#34;}
 * 
 * @param  rank  integer numerical ranking; should be in {1,2,3}
 * @return the corresponding metal color for `rank` is returned 
 *         from the set {&#34;gold&#34;, &#34;silver&#34;, &#34;bronze&#34;}.
 * @throw  std::invalid_argument is thrown if `rank` is not one
 *         of {1,2,3}.
 */
```

---

## Documentation Guidelines

```cpp
 * @throw  std::invalid_argument is thrown if `rank` is not one
 *         of {1,2,3}.
```

Notice the `@throw` Doxygen tag -- it should be used once for *each type*
of exception your function may throw.

Be sure to describe the exception *type*, as well as when/why it would
be thrown.
