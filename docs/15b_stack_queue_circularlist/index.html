# Stacks, Queues, and Circular Lists


---

## Stacks

A _stack_ is a data structure optimized for addition and removal only at one end.  It focuses on the _last-in, first-out_ access pattern.

**Stack Operations:**  Primary stack operations are:

* _**push**_ : Add a value at the &#34;top&#34; of the stack.
* _**pop**_ : Remove the value at the &#34;top&#34; of the stack.
* _**top**_ : Access the value at the &#34;top&#34; of the stack, but do not remove it.
* Operations such as &#34;write&#34;, &#34;clear&#34;, etc. are also possible.

Stacks can easily be implemented as a _singly-linked list_ where access is restricted to the &#34;front&#34;.

* `add_front()` becomes `push()` 
* `remove_front()` becomes `pop()`

---

## Queues

A _queue_ is a data structure optimized for addition at one end and removal at the other.  It focuses on the _first-in, first-out_ access pattern.

**Queue Operations:**  Primary queue operations are:

* _**enqueue**_ : Add a value at the &#34;end&#34; of the queue.
* _**dequeue**_ : Remove the value at the &#34;front&#34; of the queue.
* _**front**_ : Access the value at the &#34;front&#34; of the queue.
* Operations such as &#34;write&#34;, &#34;clear&#34;, etc. are also possible.

Queues can easily be implemented as a _singly-linked list_ where additions occur at the tail and removals are from the head (for efficiency):

* `enqueue()` becomes `add_back()` 
* `dequeue()` becomes `remove_front()`

---

## Priority Queue

A _priority queue_ is a data structure optimized to allow items to be added, then removed in an order according to some priority.

Essentially, the **enqueue** operation is an &#34;add in order&#34; operation, inserting the item in the queue according to some pre-selected priority.  For example, &#34;larger first&#34;.

**Priority Queue Operations:**  Primary queue operations are:

* _**enqueue**_ : Add a value &#34;in order&#34; according to priority.
* _**dequeue**_ : Remove the value at the &#34;front&#34; of the queue.
* _**front**_ : Access the value at the &#34;front&#34; of the queue.
* Operations such as &#34;write&#34;, &#34;clear&#34;, etc. are also possible.

Priority queues can easily be implemented as a _singly-linked list_ with in-order additions and removal from the head:

* `enqueue()` is the same as `add_in_order()` 
* `dequeue()` is the same as `remove_front()`

---

## Circular List

A _circular list_ is a list in which following the &#34;next&#34; pointer from the end of the list will place you back at the beginning of the list.

Useful for tasks that need to be repeated.

The underlying list may be a _singly-linked list_ or a _doubly-linked list_.  You can also use an array as the underlying data structure.

.center[![:scale Circular Doubly-Linked List, 80%](../images/LinkedList/CircularDoublyLinkedList.svg)]
