# Graphs: Breadth-First Traversals

##  Breadth-First Traversals

We have discussed Depth-First traversals, where the traversal choose one path and &#34;follows&#34; it as far as possible before returning to try other paths.  

The .term[Breadth-First Traversal] instead focuses on visiting all neighboring vertices before proceeding to other vertices.  

In a tree-like structure, we could visualize this as working across each level of the tree before proceeding further &#34;down&#34; toward the leaves.  

In a graph, the idea is the same - work on all vertices you can discover at the same &#34;level&#34; (distance from the start) before moving further into the graph.

---

## Breadth-First traversals utilize a Queue

Whereas depth-first traversals made use of a _stack_ as the primary &#34;bookkeeping&#34; data structure to allow backtracking, breadth-first traversals will use a _queue_ to aid in prioritizing the ordering of vertex visits.  The general algorithm is:

```text
function breadthFirstSearch(graph G):
    let unseen := all vertices from G
    let edges := empty List {}
    let working := empty Queue {}
    for each vertex v in unseen do
        remove v from unseen
        enqueue v into working
        while working is not empty do
            v := dequeue from working
            for all vertices u adjacent to v in G do
                if u is in unseen
                    enqueue u into working
                    insert edge(vu) into edges
    return edges
```

### Breadth-First traversals: Example

.footnote[Drozdek Fig. 8.5]

.center[![](../images/graphs/fig_8.5a_undirected_graph.svg)]

We&#39;ll start traversing from (a).

### Breadth-First traversals: Example

.footnote[Drozdek Fig. 8.5]

.center[![](../images/graphs/fig_8.5b_undirected_graph_breadth-first_1.svg)]

We see the nodes with edges from (a) and queue them up...

### Breadth-First traversals: Example

From (e) we don&#39;t discover anything new; just mark it and continue.

From (f) we don&#39;t discover anything new; just mark it and continue.

### Breadth-First traversals: Example

.footnote[Drozdek Fig. 8.5]

.center[![](../images/graphs/fig_8.5b_undirected_graph_breadth-first_4.svg)]


From (g) we discover (b) and add it to the queue.

### Breadth-First traversals: Example

.footnote[Drozdek Fig. 8.5]

.center[![](../images/graphs/fig_8.5b_undirected_graph_breadth-first_5.svg)]


From (i) we don&#39;t discover anything new; just mark it and continue.

Notice that the edges (ef), (ei), (fi) will not be traversed at this point.

### Breadth-First traversals: Example

.footnote[Drozdek Fig. 8.5]

.center[![](../images/graphs/fig_8.5b_undirected_graph_breadth-first_6.svg)]


From (b) we don&#39;t discover anything new; just mark it and continue.

Now our queue is empty, but we have unvisited nodes, so we pick one ( **(c)** )
and continue.

From (b) we discover (h) and add it to the queue.

### Breadth-First traversals: Example

.footnote[Drozdek Fig. 8.5]

From (h) we discover (d) and add it to the queue.

---

### Breadth-First traversals: Example

.footnote[Drozdek Fig. 8.5]

.center[![](../images/graphs/fig_8.5b_undirected_graph_breadth-first_9.svg)]


From (d) we don&#39;t discover anything new.

Also, our queue is empty now, so we check for unvisited nodes...

But there are none.  That means we are finished.

Final state, with visit ordering shown.  

Edges that were traversed are shown in solid black; edges not traversed are shown in dotted grey.
