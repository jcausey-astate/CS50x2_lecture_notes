## Linked List Efficiency

How efficient is a linked list?

--

* Adding/removing items    
    * at Head
    * at Tail
    * in-order

* Finding (searching) items
    * Ordered list?
    * Un-ordered list?

* Traversal

---

## What About Binary Search?

Recall how the binary search algorithm removed the complexity from searching an (ordered) array...

.red[What if we could do some kind of non-sequential search on a linked list?]

--

A special kind of linked list that allows just such a search is called a  _skip list_ .

## Skip List

---

By making different nodes hold different numbers of pointers\, you can search non-sequentially:

---

* In a skip list of  _n_  nodes:
  * Every second node points two nodes ahead
  * Every fourth node points four nodes ahead
  * And so on...

The “level” of a node refers to the number of pointers it has.  The highest level is given by  _log2(n) \+ 1 _  _(1-indexed_  _)\, or log2(n) _ (0-indexed) _ _  .

* To search a skip list:
  * start at the highest level\, and traverse until an element is found that is too large\, or NULL is encountered.
  * If either case occurs\, restart at the previous node\, but at the next lowest level
  * Continue until the target value is found
    * Or until you hit the NULL at the end of the first-level list.

This “perfect skip list” is easy to draw... but difficult (expensive) to achieve in practice.

Consider adding a new item / removing an item.

Nodes do not have to be perfectly distributed...

As long as the requirements are met for the number of nodes at each level\, the skip list can still work.

---

The new node can determine its number of links at random\, provided that it uses a probability distribution that (in the long run) maintains the correct proportions of levels...

### Another Take on Insertion

Keep a special “node” that points “back” at all “see-able” nodes... those you used to find the insertion point.

Use that backLook node to set the appropriate next pointers.
